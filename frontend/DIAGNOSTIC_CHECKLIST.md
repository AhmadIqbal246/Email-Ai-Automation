# 🔍 Frontend Diagnostic Checklist

## URGENT: Check if you're seeing the updated interface!

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
1. **Press Ctrl+Shift+R** to hard refresh
2. Or press **F12** → **Application** → **Storage** → **Clear site data**
3. Or use **Ctrl+F5** for force refresh

### Step 2: Verify you're on the correct port
- Make sure you're accessing: **http://localhost:5174/** (not 5173)
- The frontend is running on port 5174 now

### Step 3: Look for the Generate AI Reply Button
When you click Reply on an email, you should see:

```
Your Reply                    [🤖 Generate AI Reply]
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Type your reply here or click                   │
│ 'Generate AI Reply' to use AI...                │
│                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 4: Check Browser Console for Errors
1. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools  
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for any red error messages
4. Try clicking Reply and see if there are any JavaScript errors

### Step 5: Verify Network Calls
1. In Developer Tools, go to **Network** tab
2. Clear the network log
3. Click Reply on an email
4. Check if you see the EmailReplyModal loading properly

## ❌ If you DON'T see the "Generate AI Reply" button:

This means you're either:
1. **Using cached old version** - Clear cache and refresh
2. **On wrong port** - Make sure you're on localhost:5174
3. **Browser compatibility issue** - Try Chrome/Edge

## ❌ If you see the button but it doesn't work:

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check network tab for failed API calls to `/api/ai/generate-reply/`

## ❌ If you're still typing manual replies:

**STOP!** You need to:
1. Click the purple "Generate AI Reply" button FIRST
2. Wait for AI to populate the text area
3. THEN send the reply

## 🚨 Quick Test:
1. Go to http://localhost:5174/
2. Login and go to dashboard  
3. Click on any email
4. Click "Reply"
5. **Take a screenshot** of what you see and compare to the expected layout above

If the button is missing, you have a frontend caching/loading issue!
