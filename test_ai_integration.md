# AI Email Reply Integration - Testing Guide

## Problem Fixed
The email automation system was sending hardcoded "Thank you for your email. I've received your message and will respond soon. Best regards" replies instead of using AI-generated responses based on user's custom prompts.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Frontend Changes (EmailReplyModal.jsx)
- Added "Generate AI Reply" button 
- Added AI reply generation functionality that calls `/api/ai/generate-reply/{email_id}/`
- Added error handling for AI generation failures
- Added loading states for AI reply generation
- Updated UI to show AI generation progress

### 2. Backend Integration
The backend already had the necessary components:
- `GenerateReplyView` in `Ai_processing/views.py` 
- `AIEmailProcessor` class in `ai_service.py`
- `AIProcessingSettings` model for user prompts
- URL route: `/api/ai/generate-reply/<uuid:email_id>/`

## How it Works Now

### AI-Powered Reply Flow:
1. User clicks "Reply" on an email
2. EmailReplyModal opens with "Generate AI Reply" button
3. User clicks "Generate AI Reply"
4. Frontend calls `/api/ai/generate-reply/{email_id}/` endpoint
5. Backend `GenerateReplyView` uses `AIEmailProcessor` to:
   - Get user's custom prompt from `AIProcessingSettings`
   - Analyze the original email
   - Generate appropriate reply using OpenAI/OpenRouter
6. AI-generated reply populates the textarea
7. User can edit the reply if needed
8. User sends the reply (AI-generated or manually edited)

### User Customization:
- Users can configure AI prompts in "AI Settings" page
- Settings include:
  - Default AI prompt/instructions
  - Response tone (professional, friendly, formal, casual)
  - Maximum response length
  - Enable/disable AI processing

## Testing Steps

1. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Backend needs:
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
   # or set in .env file
   ```

2. **Start the services:**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend/email_automation_backend
   python manage.py runserver

   # Frontend  
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the integration:**
   - Go to AI Settings and configure your prompt
   - Connect a Gmail account
   - Fetch some emails
   - Click on an email to open it
   - Click "Reply" 
   - Click "Generate AI Reply" button
   - Verify AI generates a response based on your prompt
   - Send the reply

## Expected Behavior
- AI should generate contextually appropriate replies
- Replies should follow the user's custom prompt instructions
- Users can still manually edit AI-generated replies
- System falls back gracefully if AI fails

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/reusable/EmailReplyModal.jsx` - Added AI reply generation UI and functionality
